###PartModule Lister
- Do not run this from the archive volume directly.
- Overwrites previously existing output files.

**DIRECTIONS:**

Add partmodulelister.ks to _\ships\scripts_ in your KSP root directory.

On any craft with a kOS processor:
 1. Open the terminal.
 2. Enter these commands:

 ```
 copy partmodulelister from 0.
 run partmodulelister.
 ```
 3. Look in _\ships\scripts_ in the KSP root directory for a file called "verboseparts.txt".
 4. Move, copy, or rename it so if you run the script again it doesn't get overwritten.
 5. Open the file in a text editor.
