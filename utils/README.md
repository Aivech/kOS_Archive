##Utils
Scripts in the Utils folder are ingame tools used to make it easier to write scripts.
They will have:
 - The script file.
 - A .md file describing what the script does, with "_doc" appended to the filename.
 - A .txt file with the example output of the script, with "_example" appended to the filename.
 
 General rules:
  - Don't run these directly from the archive.
  - Scripts in this folder usually copy their output file to the archive.
  - Scripts in this folder usually also lack overwrite checks.
